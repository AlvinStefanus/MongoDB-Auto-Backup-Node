*** Node Typescript MongoDB Auto Backup ***

Program to auto backup mongodb using NodeJS. 

Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

* Schedule the backup *

In the `.env` file:

`SCHEDULE_TIME='0 * * * *'`

This is based on the npm package `node-schedule`. Read their documentation in here https://github.com/node-schedule/node-schedule.

`KEEP_BACKUP_FILES=7` This means that the maximum number of backup files stored in the `BACKUP_TO_LOCAL_PATH` is 7. Change the number to store more or less, but please be cautious, large files will take a lot of disk space.

`USE_TIMESTAMP=false` If this is set to true, in every backup files they will have timestamp suffix. This can be used to keep the backups if saved less than every day (every hours / minutes). Because the same backup file name will be overwriten. If your schedule is set every hour and `USE_TIMESTAMP=false`, this means that the backup file names will be the same within the same day, which causes the previous backup file will be overwriten.

*** Running The Program ***

First, build the program using `npm run build`, then run `npm run start` or `npm start`.

If you want to deploy the build folder only `dist` in your web hosting. Run this `npm run deploy`. This will build your app and also copied the `package.json` into the dist folder. Then in your hosting provider, run `npm i` and `npm start` on the `dist` folder.
